Reads a file and generates a cpp file to build copies of that file ~\newline

This project is largely created out of frustration of having to retype the contents of a file written in one programming language such as php if I want to automate the generation of that type of code through another language such as cpp. This code reads the code you want to copy and generates a cpp or a python file to do that job. Future updates will allow for more file types. This should speed up any modifications needed to automate a class if only a few portions of the code need to change. ~\newline
\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
The code is run using the command line ~\newline



\begin{DoxyPre}
./CodeGenerator <input filename> -\/o <output filename>
\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}


{\bfseries{-\/o}} [FILENAME]        outputFile
                     REQUIRED
                     The output file extension in the output filename is
                     used to determine if a python or cpp builder file 
                     needs to be created to generate the input file 
                     provided. Any other filetypes will generate an error.

The Code\+Generator file can be compiled using cmake ~\newline

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Make a build folder 
\begin{DoxyPre}
mkdir build
cd build
\end{DoxyPre}

\item Run CMAKE 
\begin{DoxyPre}
cmake ../src
cmake -\/-\/build .
\end{DoxyPre}

\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Make}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
I also have a simple Make file included that will store the executable in the build folder and any objects needed to build the file in the objs folder 
\begin{DoxyPre}
make cmd 
make run
\end{DoxyPre}
